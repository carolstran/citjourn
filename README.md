## How citjourn Works
Anyone can share their story by uploading a local image, along with a title, username and description.

Others on the site can comment on an image or verify a story - similar to a ‘like’ button.

## Other Key Aspects
- Images are displayed as cards using Flexbox
- Utilizes Amazon's S3 for image hosting
- Hosted on [Heroku](https://citjourn.herokuapp.com/)
- Special thanks to everyone who let me upload and share their stories (yes, they're all real!)
