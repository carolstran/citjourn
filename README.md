# citjourn
An image board SPA (Single-Page Application) to help mobilize citizen journalism.

Anyone can share their story by uploading a local image, along with a title, username and description. Images are displayed as cards using Flexbox. Others on the site can comment on an image or verify a story - similar to a ‘like’ button.

Technologies: AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL and Amazon S3 for image storage.

Hosted on [Heroku](https://citjourn.herokuapp.com/).
